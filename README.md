#  Windows10 GameDVR fix

## Introduction

Simple application for friends that remove the GameDVR function to increase FPS in games. This is done by downloading an up to date [registry file](https://github.com/brian8544/windows10_gamedvr_fix/blob/main/registry_file/DVR_Disable.reg). (which you can ofcourse also execute without this application!)

## Requirements

[.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
